# nosql-challenge
In this challenge we are looking at a json file (establishents) filled with information about all the local watering holes in the United Kingdom. In a desperate search to find the best place for a Guiness and fish 'n chips near you! On a more serious note we used the first (setup_starter) in order to add a restuarant into our datafile and even grab informaiton from another restuarant in order to complete the original restuarant file. In the second (analysis_starter) we are able to make searches on our data in order to rank places by their Rating, Hygiene score and distance from certain locations. So on a less serious note, I guess we could find that Guiness and fish 'n chips after all!
